### Liquidity Book Visualisation Tool

Liquidity Book (LB) is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) designed and deployed by Trader Joe (TJ). Its mechanism is similar to traditional CLOBs (central limit order books), as it places buy- and sell-side liquidity in discrete "pricing bins".  

This project is designed to visualise the state of any particular LB pair across a specified interval and log the changes as the liquidity is deposited/withdrawn and moved in response to market conditions.
